# Facebook-Homepage-Clone

This project is a clone of Facebook Homepage, using the January 2026 version as a reference.
This is my very first project ever, using only HTML and CSS, as well as discovering how to use GitHub in the process.
Moreover, this project was done approximately 2 working weeks during my second year in college.
